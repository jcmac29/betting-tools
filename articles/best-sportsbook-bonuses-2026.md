## What Makes a Good Sportsbook Bonus?

Before diving into specific offers, let's understand what separates great bonuses from mediocre ones. Not all promotions are created equal, and the headline number doesn't always tell the full story.

### Key Factors to Consider

**Wagering Requirements**: This is the most important factor many bettors overlook. A $500 bonus with a 10x wagering requirement means you need to wager $5,000 before withdrawing. Lower is always better.

**Minimum Odds Requirements**: Some bonuses only count toward wagering requirements if you bet at -200 or longer odds. This prevents you from grinding out the bonus on heavy favorites.

**Time Limits**: Most bonuses expire within 7-30 days. Make sure you have enough time to meet the requirements without rushing into bad bets.

**Eligible Bet Types**: Certain sportsbooks exclude parlays, live betting, or specific sports from bonus wagering requirements.

## How to Maximize Your Sportsbook Bonuses

### Strategy 1: Multi-Platform Sign-Ups

Nothing stops you from signing up at multiple sportsbooks and claiming each welcome bonus. This is the single best way to maximize your bonus value as a new bettor.

**Example Approach:**
1. Start with DraftKings ($5 bet for $200 guaranteed)
2. Move to FanDuel ($500 first bet for insurance)
3. Use BetMGM for largest wager ($1,000+ first bet)

This strategy can yield $500+ in bonus value across platforms.

### Strategy 2: Matched Betting on First Bets

For insurance-style offers, consider placing your first bet on an outcome and using another sportsbook to bet the opposite side. This minimizes variance while still capturing the bonus value if your insured bet loses.

### Strategy 3: Use Bonus Bets on Plus-Odds Wagers

Since bonus bet stakes aren't returned with winnings, they're more valuable on plus-odds bets. A $100 bonus bet at +150 returns $150 in withdrawable cash, while the same bet at -150 returns only $66.67.

## Common Bonus Terms Explained

Understanding bonus terminology prevents surprises when trying to withdraw:

**Playthrough/Rollover**: How many times you must wager the bonus before withdrawing. A $100 bonus with 5x playthrough requires $500 in total wagers.

**Bonus Bets vs. Site Credit**: Bonus bets don't return the stake with winnings; site credit does. This makes bonus bets worth roughly 70% of their face value.

**Qualifying Bet**: The bet you must place to unlock the bonus, often with minimum odds requirements.

**Expiration**: When unused bonus funds disappear. Always check this before claiming.

## State Availability
