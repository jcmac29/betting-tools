# Bankroll Management for Sports Betting: The Complete Guide

*Last Updated: February 2026*

Bankroll management is the most important skill in sports betting that nobody talks about. You can pick winners at a 60% rate, but without proper bankroll management, you can still go broke. Meanwhile, a disciplined bettor hitting 53% can build wealth over time.

This guide will teach you how to manage your betting money like a professional. Whether you're betting $100 or $10,000, these principles apply equally.

## What is Bankroll Management?

Bankroll management is a system for determining how much to wager on each bet based on your total betting funds (bankroll). It's designed to:

- Prevent catastrophic losses
- Maximize long-term growth
- Reduce emotional decision-making
- Survive inevitable losing streaks
- Turn a modest edge into consistent profits

Think of your bankroll as your betting business's capital. No successful business puts 100% of its capital into a single venture. Your bankroll deserves the same protection.

## Setting Your Starting Bankroll

Your bankroll should be money you can afford to lose completely. This is not your savings, rent money, or emergency fund.

### How Much Should Your Starting Bankroll Be?

There's no universal answer, but here are guidelines:

**Recreational Bettors:** $200-$500
- Enough to absorb variance
- Small enough that losses don't cause stress
- Allows proper unit sizing

**Serious Bettors:** $1,000-$5,000
- Supports meaningful returns
- Handles longer losing streaks
- Enables multiple sportsbook accounts

**Professional Approach:** $10,000+
- Optimal for professional-level betting
- Allows minimal risk per bet
- Supports maximum long-term growth

### The Golden Rule

**Never add to your bankroll from outside sources.** If you lose your bankroll, either stop betting or take a significant break. Adding money to chase losses is the path to serious financial problems.

## Understanding Units

In bankroll management, bets are measured in "units" rather than dollars. A unit is a standardized bet size based on your bankroll.

### What is a Unit?

One unit equals a fixed percentage of your bankroll, typically 1-5%.

**Example:**
- Bankroll: $1,000
- 1 Unit: $10-$50 (at 1-5%)

### Why Use Units?

Units accomplish several things:

1. **Standardization:** Compare results across different bankroll sizes
2. **Risk Control:** Prevents oversized bets
3. **Track Performance:** "+5 units" means the same relative success regardless of bankroll size
4. **Psychological:** Removes dollar amounts from decision-making

### Determining Your Unit Size

| Risk Tolerance | Unit Size | Units in Bankroll |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Conservative | 1% | 100 units |
| Moderate | 2% | 50 units |
| Aggressive | 3% | 33 units |
| Very Aggressive | 5% | 20 units |

**Our Recommendation:** Start with 1-2% units. You can always increase later, but you can't recover money lost to oversized bets.

## Bankroll Management Strategies

Several systems exist for managing your bankroll. Each has strengths and appropriate use cases.

### Flat Betting (Recommended for Most Bettors)

Flat betting means wagering the same amount on every bet, regardless of confidence level.

**How It Works:**
- Set your unit size (e.g., 2% of bankroll)
- Bet exactly one unit on every wager
- Recalculate unit size periodically (weekly or monthly)

**Example with $1,000 Bankroll:**
- Unit size: $20 (2%)
- Every bet is $20
- After winning $200, new bankroll is $1,200
- New unit size: $24 (2% of $1,200)

**Advantages:**
- Simple to implement
- Removes emotional bet sizing
- Protects against losing streaks
- No temptation to "go big" on "locks"

**Disadvantages:**
- Doesn't account for varying confidence levels
- May feel overly conservative

**Best For:** New bettors, recreational bettors, and anyone who struggles with discipline.

### Confidence-Based Betting

This system varies bet size based on how confident you are in each pick.

**How It Works:**
- Establish a rating scale (1-5 or 1-10)
- Assign confidence level to each bet
- Bet units equal to confidence level

**Example:**
- 5-star pick: 5 units
- 3-star pick: 3 units
- 1-star pick: 1 unit

**Advantages:**
- Maximizes return on strongest plays
- Intuitively appealing
- Rewards research and analysis

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires accurate self-assessment
- Easy to overestimate confidence
- Can lead to oversized bets on "sure things"

**Warning:** Most bettors overestimate their highest-confidence plays. If you use this system, your 5-star plays need to win at a significantly higher rate than lower-rated picks. Track your results by confidence level to verify your assessments are accurate.

### The Kelly Criterion

The Kelly Criterion is a mathematically optimal betting system used by professional bettors and financial traders.

**The Formula:**
Kelly % = (bp - q) / b

Where:
- b = decimal odds - 1
- p = your estimated probability of winning
- q = probability of losing (1 - p)

**Example:**
- Odds: +150 (2.50 decimal)
- Your estimated win probability: 45%
- b = 2.50 - 1 = 1.50
- p = 0.45
- q = 0.55

Kelly % = (1.50 × 0.45 - 0.55) / 1.50
Kelly % = (0.675 - 0.55) / 1.50
Kelly % = 0.0833 or 8.33%

**Advantages:**
- Mathematically optimal for maximum growth
- Accounts for odds and probability
- Self-adjusting based on edge

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires accurate probability estimates
- Full Kelly is extremely aggressive
- Variance can be stomach-churning

**Practical Application:**
Most Kelly users bet "Half Kelly" or "Quarter Kelly" to reduce variance while maintaining the system's benefits.

**Best For:** Advanced bettors who can accurately estimate probabilities and handle volatility.

### The 1-3-2-6 System

A progressive betting system that increases bets after wins.

**How It Works:**
- Bet 1 unit
- If win, bet 3 units
- If win, bet 2 units
- If win, bet 6 units
- After any loss or completing the sequence, restart at 1 unit

**Advantages:**
- Capitalizes on winning streaks
- Limits downside (only 1 unit at risk to start)
- Systematic progression

**Disadvantages:**
- Any loss resets progress
- Doesn't account for varying confidence
- More gambling than investing

**Best For:** Recreational bettors who want structure but accept higher variance.

## Managing Losing Streaks

Every bettor faces losing streaks. Your system must account for them.

### Expected Variance

Even with a 55% win rate (very good), losing streaks happen:

| Streak Length | Probability |
|---------------|-------------|
| 3 losses | 9.1% |
| 5 losses | 1.8% |
| 7 losses | 0.4% |
| 10 losses | 0.03% |

Over 1,000 bets at 55% win rate, you will experience multiple 5+ game losing streaks. Your bankroll must survive these.

### Why Small Unit Sizes Matter

**With 5% units:** 5 straight losses = 25% of bankroll gone

**With 2% units:** 5 straight losses = 10% of bankroll gone

**With 1% units:** 5 straight losses = 5% of bankroll gone

The smaller your unit size, the more losing streaks you can survive.

### Rules for Losing Streaks

1. **Never increase bet size to recoup losses** - This is called "chasing" and leads to disaster
2. **Stick to your system** - The streak will end
3. **Consider reducing unit size** - A smaller unit during a cold streak protects your bankroll
4. **Take a break if needed** - Sometimes stepping away clears your head
5. **Review your process** - Are you making sound decisions, or has something changed?

## Bankroll Growth and Withdrawals

As your bankroll grows (or shrinks), your system should adapt.

### When to Increase Units

Recalculate your unit size regularly:

**Conservative Approach:**
- Recalculate monthly
- Only increase unit size, never decrease
- Provides smooth growth

**Dynamic Approach:**
- Recalculate weekly
- Increase and decrease with bankroll changes
- Maximizes compounding

### Taking Profits

You should enjoy your winnings. Here's how to withdraw responsibly:

**The 50/50 Rule:**
When your bankroll doubles, withdraw 50% of the profits.

**Example:**
- Starting bankroll: $1,000
- Bankroll after growth: $2,000
- Profit: $1,000
- Withdraw: $500 (50% of profit)
- New bankroll: $1,500

This approach lets you enjoy success while maintaining a growing bankroll.

### Rebuilding After Losses

If your bankroll drops significantly, decrease your unit size proportionally. This preserves your remaining capital and gives you more bets to recover.

**Example:**
- Starting bankroll: $1,000 with $20 units
- After losses: $600
- New unit size: $12 (still 2%)

Never maintain the same unit size with a smaller bankroll. That's a recipe for going broke.

## Setting Up Your System

Let's put this into practice with a step-by-step setup.

### Step 1: Define Your Bankroll

Decide on an amount you can afford to lose. Deposit this into your sportsbook accounts [AFFILIATE LINK].

### Step 2: Choose Your Unit Size

For most bettors, 1-2% is appropriate. If you're very conservative, go with 1%. If you're comfortable with variance, 2-3%.

### Step 3: Select Your Strategy

- **New bettors:** Start with flat betting
- **Intermediate:** Consider confidence-based with tight limits
- **Advanced:** Explore fractional Kelly

### Step 4: Create a Tracking System

Track every bet with:
- Date
- Sport/League
- Bet details
- Odds
- Units wagered
- Confidence level (if applicable)
- Result
- Running profit/loss

Spreadsheets work well, or use tracking apps like Action Network.

### Step 5: Set Rules and Stick to Them

Write down your rules:
- Maximum units per day
- Maximum units per bet
- What to do during losing streaks
- When to recalculate unit size
- Withdrawal schedule

Having written rules prevents emotional decisions in the moment.

## Common Bankroll Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Betting Too Large

The most common mistake. Betting 10%+ of your bankroll per bet is a recipe for disaster. Even with an edge, variance will eventually wipe you out.

**Solution:** Keep units at 1-3% maximum.

### Mistake 2: Chasing Losses

After losing, the temptation to bet bigger to "get even" is powerful. This leads to even bigger losses.

**Solution:** Stick to your unit size regardless of recent results.

### Mistake 3: No Tracking

Without records, you can't evaluate your performance or identify leaks.

**Solution:** Track every bet from day one.

### Mistake 4: Treating All Bets Equally

Not all +100 bets are equal. A +100 bet with a 53% edge is very different from +100 with a 48% edge.

**Solution:** Understand true probabilities, not just perceived confidence.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Bankroll Swings

Maintaining the same unit size regardless of bankroll changes is dangerous in both directions.

**Solution:** Recalculate units regularly based on current bankroll.

### Mistake 6: Using Scared Money

Betting with money you can't afford to lose leads to poor decisions driven by fear.

**Solution:** Only bet with truly disposable income.

## Sample Bankroll Management Plan

Here's a complete example you can adapt:

**Starting Bankroll:** $1,000

**Unit Size:** 2% ($20)

**Betting Strategy:** Flat betting with maximum 5 units per day

**Rules:**
1. Every bet is exactly 1 unit ($20)
2. Maximum 5 bets per day
3. Recalculate unit size every Monday
4. If bankroll drops below $500, reduce to 1% units
5. If bankroll doubles, withdraw 50% of profits
6. Track all bets in spreadsheet
7. Review results weekly
8. Take 1-day break after losing 10+ units in a week

**Tracking Fields:**
Date | Sport | Bet | Odds | Units | Result | P/L | Running Total

This system provides structure while remaining flexible enough for different situations.

## The Psychology of Bankroll Management

Managing money is as much psychological as mathematical.

### Accepting Variance

You will have losing days, weeks, and even months despite making good bets. Accepting this intellectually is easy; accepting it emotionally is harder.

**Tip:** Focus on process over results. Did you make a sound betting decision? That's what matters, not whether it won.

### Removing Emotion

Your betting system should remove emotion from the equation. When you have clear rules, you don't have to make decisions in the heat of the moment.

**Tip:** Never deviate from your system "just this once."

### The Long Game

Sports betting is a marathon, not a sprint. A 2% edge over thousands of bets will make you money. Trying to get rich quick will make you poor quickly.

**Tip:** Think in terms of months and years, not days and weeks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much should I bet per game?

Most bettors should bet 1-3% of their bankroll per game. Never exceed 5% on any single bet.

### Should I bet more on "sure things"?

Be very cautious. Most "sure things" aren't as sure as they feel. If you use confidence-based betting, verify your confidence is calibrated by tracking results.

### How often should I recalculate my unit size?

Weekly or monthly is appropriate for most bettors. More frequent recalculation adds complexity without much benefit.

### What if I'm on a winning streak?

Stay disciplined. Winning streaks end just like losing streaks. Stick to your unit size and let compounding work naturally.

### Should I have separate bankrolls for different sportsbooks?

You can view it as one total bankroll across platforms or manage each separately. Having accounts at multiple sportsbooks [AFFILIATE LINK] is wise for line shopping regardless.

### How long until I see consistent profits?

With a small edge, you need hundreds of bets to see meaningful results. Short-term results are dominated by variance. Focus on process and give yourself time.
