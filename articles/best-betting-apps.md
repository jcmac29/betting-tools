## What Makes a Great Sports Betting App?

## Multi-App Strategy: Why You Should Use Several

The smartest bettors don't commit to a single app. Here's why you should have accounts at multiple sportsbooks:

### Line Shopping

Different sportsbooks offer different odds. Having multiple accounts lets you always get the best line.

**Example:**
- DraftKings: Chiefs -3 (-110)
- FanDuel: Chiefs -2.5 (-115)
- BetMGM: Chiefs -3 (-105)

Betting at BetMGM saves money; betting at FanDuel gets you a better line. Without multiple accounts, you're stuck with whatever one book offers.

### Promotional Stacking

Every sportsbook offers daily boosts and promotions. With multiple accounts, you access more promotions than any single app provides.

### Welcome Bonus Multiplication

Sign up at all the major sportsbooks [AFFILIATE LINK] and claim each welcome bonus. There's no rule against this, and it's the easiest way to boost your starting bankroll.
